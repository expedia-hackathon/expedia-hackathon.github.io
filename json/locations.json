      "description": "Carved millions of years ago by the Colorado River and natural geological processes, the Grand Canyon’s stark beauty, rusty, desert colors and glorious sunsets pull tourists from across the globe. For Las Vegas visitors, this national treasure is a manageable overnight trip at about 227 miles (365 kilometers) from the city.\n\nThe canyon’s easily accessible south rim is the most popular spot with visitors. Much of the Grand Canyon National Park’s infrastructure is based here, including the Canyon View Information Plaza, which includes the Grand Canyon Visitor Center. Here you’ll find helpful guides, brochures, audiovisual displays and interactive features about the area’s fascinating history, geology and wildlife. Hop on the free shuttle bus (cost included in the entry fee to the national park) to visit other museums and viewpoints around the south rim.\n\nAlthough it’s difficult to tear your eyes away from the canyon’s swooping vistas, a hike below the rim will give you a greater sense of the landscape’s beauty. Canyon hikes bring you closer to prehistoric plant life and the corrosive power of the Colorado River, which stripped back layer upon layer of rock over millions of years.\n\nFor a bird’s-eye view, several companies offer chartered helicopter flights over the south rim and the less accessible north and west rims. From the sky, you’ll get a true sense of the canyon’s phenomenal size, rugged terrain and magnificent colors. If you’re lucky, you may even spot a coyote or California condor. Temperatures often dip once the sun goes down, but the sunset is not to be missed.\n\nMany visitors choose to spend the night in order to spend two days at the Canyon. Accommodation within and near the national park ranges from comfortable hotels and rustic lodges to quaint cabins and campsites. For those who prefer not to drive, bus and helicopter tours depart Las Vegas regularly.",

The city that was rebuilt after 1945 presents a fascinating blend of ancient tradition and modern leadership.\n\nGo to the top of a skyscraper for impressive views of this seemingly endless city. From the Rainbow Bridge, Tokyo Tower, Mori Tower and Tokyo Skytree, you’ll see iconic landmarks in Japan’s modern skyline and even beyond to Mount Fuji.

See art and artifacts from ancient Japan and other Asian countries in the Tokyo National Museum. Its collection includes items up to 12,000 years old. The Tokyo Imperial Palace sits on the site that has been home to shoguns and emperors for centuries.\n\nLearn about traditional Buddhist spirituality dating back to 645 at the Sensoji Temple. The Yasukuni Shrine and Yushukan Museum showcase Shinto efforts to commemorate the services of the more than 2 million citizens who died in service to their country over the last century and a half.\n\nTokyo is constantly rebuilding and reinventing itself. The Roppongi Hills multi-use complex was created in 2003 in the heart of the city and provides some of the trendiest scenes for nighttime entertainment. It’s especially popular with expats.\n\nAlthough Tokyo is densely populated, it has plenty of green space throughout its 23 wards. Late March and early April feature the famous Japanese cherry blossoms. One of the most popular places to enjoy the flora with a picnic lunch is Shinjuku Gyoen. Parks in every district are carefully designed with detailed landscape architecture to provide oases for Japan’s citizens and visitors to relax and refresh.",

Here, modern skyscrapers sit near Buddhist temples and art deco buildings, while sleek museums stand alongside manicured gardens and cramped alleys.

At the Shanghai History Museum, find out more about the city’s origins as a small fishing and textiles town that transitioned into a popular destination for foreigners to establish homes and businesses.\n\nTo see the city from different perspectives, walk along the riverfront promenade known as the Bund. Marvel at the various architectural styles visible from the walkway. For a bird’s-eye view, head for the observation deck at the Shanghai Tower.\n\nWhen the weather is nice, visitors and locals converge on the Yùyuán Gardens to stroll, sit in the shade and watch colorful fish swimming around in the pools. Soak up the sun with a boat trip in Zhujiajiao, a historic water town in the suburbs, known for its Ming- and Qing-era bridges. If it’s raining, consider taking shelter in Xīntiāndì, a shopping and entertainment complex packed with boutique shops and restaurants.\n\nExplore the city’s religious past at the Buddhist Jìng’ān Temple. Smell the burning incense and inspect the ornate statues that decorate the halls. Other notable Buddhist sites include the Jade Buddha Temple, one of the only active monasteries remaining in Shanghai.\n\nBook your vacation in the spring or fall for the best weather or visit in the first week of October during the National Day holiday when crowds flock to the city for celebrations. Fly into one of two international airports, Hongqiao or Pudong, to start your journey through the region.\n\nUpscale shopping complexes, ancient temples and relaxing gardens make Shanghai a top destination for travelers looking to experience modern-day China.",

The new capital was inaugurated on 13 February 1931, by Viceroy and Governor-General of India Lord Irwin.\n\nLaid out by British architect Edwin Lutyens, the Indian capital is a striking modern metropolis. A gracious contrast to Old Delhi's winding streets, the grand avenues and stately buildings of New Delhi are rich with history and culture, from Gandhi's Delhi home (and the site of his assassination) to the tomb of Humayun, a complex of Mughal buildings reminiscent of the Taj Mahal. Chaotic traffic is best left to the locals. Negotiate a good price for taxis or travel on the new Delhi Metro.\n\nExplore the historic city of New Delhi—shopping, temples, and popular sights from Jantar Mantar to Jama Masjid!",

Classic landmarks include the ancient Notre Dame cathedral, Arc de Triomphe the Eiffel Tower, and contemporary architectural achievements such as the La Défense district.\n\nThe city is divided into 20 arrondissements, or districts, which spiral clockwise from the city’s center. Paris is also split by the river Seine into the Left and Right Banks. Each arrondissement and area of Paris has its own character and flair. Le Marais is best known for medieval architecture, intimate wine bars and a diverse community. Luxembourg has a special old-world charm, enchanting gardens, and proximity to the upscale St-Germain-des-Prés. Montmartre is famous for its cobbled streets, the Moulin Rouge and magnificent Basilique du Sacré Cœur (Basilica of the Sacred Heart).\n\nParis is easy to navigate, either by the quick Metro system or taking your time by foot. Meandering through the winding streets, it’s easy to see the French passion for food and wine. There are open-air produce markets, patisserie windows piled with croissants and macaroons, and wine shops with offerings from regional vineyards. Restaurants of all kinds abound: traditional silver service venues, sidewalk cafes and rustic coffee houses.\n\nParis has fostered many artistic talents, including Édith Piaf, Serge Gainsbourg, Claude Monet and Coco Chanel. It’s known the world over for its museums and galleries such as the opulent Musée d'Orsay and the Pompidou Centre’s National Museum of Modern Art. For performance art, spend an evening at the beautifully decorated Palais Garnier, also known as the Opéra de Paris. Internationally renowned opera and ballet companies perform here regularly.\n\nFashion, too, is ingrained in the Parisian psyche. Stroll along Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré to find some of the most revered fashion houses in the world, including Lanvin, Hermes and Dior.\n\nVisitors overwhelmed by all that Paris has to offer should head to the Champs-Élysées. Here you can wander and enjoy the beauty of this famous tree-lined boulevard, stop at Ladurée patisserie for a macaroon, or visit La Maison Guerlain’s shrine to perfume.",

      "description": "Walk on the cobblestone streets and arched bridges of this pedestrian-friendly island city in northeastern Italy and let your senses guide you. Hear the water lap against the gondolas in the canals. Breathe in the aroma of fresh Italian food and taste quality wine on the restaurant terraces. Feel the sun warm your skin as you wander through St. Mark's Square (Piazza San Marco) and listen to street musicians perform serenades to lovers.\n\nEven in the cooler winter months, Venice is bustling. Summer days can get hot and crowded, while autumn and spring are usually the most pleasant times to visit. It is easy to visit all premier attractions in just a few days. St. Mark’s Square is magnificent and a good place to start. Two of Venice’s most spectacular buildings, St. Mark’s Basilica (Basilica di San Marco) and the Doge’s Palace (Palazzo Ducale), rub shoulders at the east end of the square. Find the best example of Venice’s Byzantine influence in the basilica, with its ornate golden mosaics and elaborate domes. The palace impresses with ostentatious displays of wealth and power.\n\nThe S-shaped Grand Canal brings you to most attractions. You could spend hours just watching gondolas and vaporettos (water buses), or hop on one yourself for a romantic boat ride. Glide past buildings such as the Gothic-style palace Ca’ d’Oro, the Basilica of St. Mary of Health (Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute) and beneath the iconic Rialto Bridge (Ponte di Rialto). Stop for a plate of risi e bise (rice and peas) at a traditional osterie (a bar serving food).\n\nDon’t miss treasures such as the Chiesa Santa Maria dei Miracoli, a 15th-century marble church. Take a ferry ride to the islands of Murano and Burano. Both are known for their artisans who work with glass and lace respectively. The islands make for a peaceful day trip away from the chaotic but irresistible heart of Venice.\n\nSavor your days in the Floating City and enjoy the Italian passion for food, romance and style!",

      "description": "Machu Picchu is a terraced citadel with remains of temples, palaces, fountain and altars. The fabled “Lost City of the Incas” is thought to have been constructed by the Incas around 1450 and is an architectural marvel.\n\nThe citadel sits 7,970 feet (2,430 meters) above sea level in the Sacred Valley northwest of Cusco. It remains a mystery what purpose Machu Picchu served and why it was abandoned. In the centuries that followed its abandonment, the jungle hid the isolated city from sight until it was uncovered in 1911.\n\nWalk up to the Guardhouse and Funeral Rock to get the full overview of the mystical city with its comical free-roaming llamas. Visit the semicircular Temple of the Sun, the Palace of the Princess and the Temple of the Three Windows. Don’t miss the Intihuatana, a carved stone marking the winter solstice.\n\nDue to the thin air and humidity, it is a good idea to pace yourself as you explore the sacred buildings. Notice how, without the aid of advanced tools, the Incas cut and stacked the huge stone blocks to fit precisely.\n\nMake sure to plan ahead to visit the world-famous city in the sky, as there is only a limited amount of visitors allowed on-site and getting there takes 3 to 4 hours. Take the train to Aguas Calientes from Poroy, a small village near Cusco, or from Ollantaytambo further down the line. The luxury option is to take a one-day package tour from Cusco with a guide. Purchase your Machu Picchu entrance ticket in Aguas Calientes before you take the bus or hike up the mountain. If you also want to climb Huayna Picchu and Machu Picchu Mountain, book special tickets through the government website for Machu Picchu. Students receive a discount.\n\nBring lunch, water and an information booklet, as there are few facilities on the mountain. Aim to arrive just before sunrise to see Machu Picchu lit in full glory.",

It was strategically located between the Magdalena and Sinú rivers and became the main port for trade between Spain and its overseas empire, establishing its importance by the early 1540s. During the colonial era it was a key port for the export of Peruvian silver to Spain and for the import of enslaved Africans under the asiento system. It was defensible against pirate attacks in the Caribbean. It is the capital of the Bolívar Department, and had a population 971,592 as of 2016. It is the fifth-largest city in Colombia and the second largest in the region, after Barranquilla. The urban area of Cartagena is also the fifth-largest urban area in the country. Economic activities include the maritime and petrochemicals industries, as well as tourism.\n\nCartagena is a gorgeous fishing village which has excellent beaches, a historic old town (that's entirely walkable) and beautiful colonial architecture. It's also one of the safest places in the country, so it's no wonder it's a popular port of call for cruise ships. Need a break from exploring the cobblestone streets? Stop at an outdoor cafe for excellent pastries and people-watching!\n\nCome discover the historic area of Cartagena—amazing beaches, gourmet restaurants, and top sights from Puerta del Reloj to San Pedro Claver Church and Convent!",

More tourists visit Cape Town than anywhere else in South Africa.\n\nThe story of the city’s past is written in its architecture. The colonizing Dutch left their mark with their unique “Cape Dutch” style. Look for houses with decorative front gables.

Eat local dishes from the street carts in the Bo-Kaap district, including Babotie, a spicy-meat dish. Try freshly caught seafood in fine-dining restaurants at the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront.\n\nLow humidity makes the summer heat bearable, while winters can be quite wet. Escape the rain and learn about the city’s history at the Jewish Museum, Slave Lodge and the South African Maritime Museum. Hear stories from former prisoners at nearby Robben Island, where former president Nelson Mandela was held before the abolishment of apartheid.\n\nA wild coastline surrounds the city and peninsula. Unwind at picturesque St. James, admire the Twelve Apostles mountain range from Camps Bay Beach and enjoy scenic drives around Hout Bay. Table Mountain National Park covers 75 percent of the peninsula. Get face-to-face with African penguins at Boulders Beach or spot baboons, antelopes and whales as you hike the trails at the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nCape Town lies on the southwest coast of South Africa. The city and surrounding countryside is best explored by car. Note that due to extreme poverty in some townships, safety is a concern. The city is relatively safe by South African standards but take necessary precautions: don’t carry valuables, lock your doors while driving and stick to tourist areas that are generally well guarded.",
